# daily-jelly ðŸŒ±
Chrome Extension that shows a new random Jellycat to users once a day. Users can access the link to the official Jellycat store to buy the Jellycat from the extension and add the Jellycat to their collection. All pictures/links/descriptions were scraped from the Jellycat store (https://www.jellycat.com/us/). Cute and fun extension that I made for myself using the IndexedDB and Chrome Storage API as well as JavaScript.

# to do
- keep count of how many jellycat users has collected/show number of pages in collection
- automate updating jellycat database regularly (certain jellycats become unavailable/out of stock on website)
- test/fix formatting/clean up code
